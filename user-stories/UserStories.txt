Story 1 (Extra):
Joe wants to look at the top recommended Ski-Resorts in a given location (The Three Valleys), for his next holiday. 
This would allow to narrow the Resorts that he might be interested in.

Story 2: 
Joe would like the ability to specify his favourite Ski-Resorts so that he can be notified (via Push Notification and Email),
if there has been any snowfall that day at that particular resorts. This would allow him to plan his trips for the days after snowfall
as they will be better for skiing.

Story 3:
Pete Wants to have access to a system that shows him information about each ski-resort usage and raitings on the app to see
the companies sucess and failures. This could be used in raiting lists and possibly a customer review system.

Story 4:
Pete Needs the ability to acess user accounts to issue for example: Password Reissuing as users can get locked out of there accounts

Story 5:
Joe wants to have the website saved to his devices like: Phones, Laptops and maybe PDAs which can be used when out skiing, 
this would increase usability of the applications.
