Story 1 (Extra):
Joe wants to look at the top recommended Ski-Resorts in a given location (The Three Valleys), for his next holiday. 
This would allow to narrow the Resorts that he might be interested in.

Story 2: 
Joe would like the ability to specify his favourite Ski-Resorts so that he can be notified (via Push Notification and/or Email),
if there has been any snowfall that day at that particular resorts. This would allow him to plan his trips for the days after snowfall
as they will be better for skiing.

Story 3:
Pete Wants to have access to a system that shows him information about each ski-resort usage and raitings on the app to see
the companies sucess and failures. This could be used in raiting lists and possibly a customer review system.

Story 4:
Pete Needs the ability to access user accounts to issue for example: Password Reissuing as users can get locked out of there accounts.

Story 5:
Joe wants to have the website saved to his devices like: Phones, Laptops and maybe PDAs which can be used when at a resort, 
this would increase usability of the applications.

Story 6: 
Joe would like the ability to load the webapp without connection to the internet and load previously used data, this would allow him
to check whilst on the trail.

Story 7:
Joe would like to look at a map of the skiing/snowboarding trails accessible at the resorts in The Three Valleys, this would help
him to plan his next trip on the trails more effectively.
